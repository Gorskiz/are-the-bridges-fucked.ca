# Are The Bridges Fucked? .CA 🌉🤷‍♂️

Welcome to the *unofficial*, *unfiltered*, and *undeniably better* way to check if the Macdonald or MacKay bridges are currently a parking lot.

## Why? 
Because the [official site](https://halifaxharbourbridges.ca/) has the charm of a 1998 Geocities page and the user experience of a tax audit. Haligonians deserve better. We deserve to know if we're going to be late for work *in style*.

## What is this?
A bespoke, high-performance web application dedicated to answering the age-old Halifax question:  
**"Can I get across the harbour, or should I just go home?"**

## The Tech Stack 🛠️
We're building this bad boy with the good stuff:
*   **React** (Because we're fancy)
*   **TypeScript** (Because we have trust issues and love type safety)
*   **Vite** (Because waiting for builds is so 2019)

## Features (Planned)
*   **Real-time Fucked-ness Levels**: Is it "Smooth Sailing" or "Abandon Hope"?
*   **Cheeky Status Updates**: No bureaucratic jargon here.
*   **Modern Design**: Dark mode? Animations? You bet.

## Disclaimer
*Status: Currently under construction 🚧*

*Not officially associated with Halifax Harbour Bridges. We just want to get to Dartmouth (or Halifax) without losing our minds.*
